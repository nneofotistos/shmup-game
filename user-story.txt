As a user see a screen load. 
On my screen I want to see:
 One ship, Group of enemies, Score, Lives, Bombs, Power meter, power and bomb pick ups

Ship can move in 8 directions, shoot, and use bombs

As a user I want to be able to shoot an enemy
 I want an enemy to dissapear when shot and score count to increase by 1000
 Enemies should randomly drop power pick ups when killed

As a user I want to be able to use a bomb
 Bombs destroy all enemies and enemy bullets on screen
 Bomb pickups are rare

Power pick ups add 5 points to the power meter
Lose all power after losing a life
Power ups at certain amount of power meter 
    i.e, at 25 power you shoot more bullets/increase bullet speed, at 100 you shoot even more/even faster bullets

Ship should be destroyed on contact with enemies and enemy bullets
 Lose 1 life and 50000 points when destroyed


not happening:
Enemy group patterns?
Bullet patterns?
Bosses?

Bullet hell or galaga? idk

help :)
